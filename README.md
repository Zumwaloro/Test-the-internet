# Test the internet
 The aim of this project is to test different web elements with the Selenium test automation software together with JUnit5. I used http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ for the project. The Java code includes 14 different test cases that covers unique web features like dynamic elements, dropdown menus, tables, etc.
